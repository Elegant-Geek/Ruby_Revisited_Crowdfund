BASIC INSTRUCTIONS
This gem funds and defunds your projects at random via die roll.
The final list of projects is then exported to your current directory after the program has finished ('quit' to exit).

TO RUN DEFAULT CSV SHEET (Three example projects))):
crowdfund

TO RUN A CSV FILE FROM YOUR CURRENT DIRECTORY:
crowdfund your_file_name.csv

NOTE: All CSV files must be formatted appropriately with:
No header or other text at the top!
Column 1: lists all project titles in plain text.
Column 2: lists integer values for initial project funding amounts (A blank field by default initializes a project with $0 in funding.)
Column 3: lists integer values for the project's target goal in funding (A blank field by default initializes a project with $10,000 in funding.)
